# SpeedRSS widget
# The widget is static HTML/JS and does not use environment variables.
# It is served by the main SpeedRSS API at /widget (see main .env for PORT).
#
# To embed on another site, use an iframe with src pointing at your SpeedRSS API:
#   https://your-speedrss-domain.com/widget
# Or, if hosting the widget elsewhere, pass the API base URL via query:
#   https://your-site.com/widget?api=https://your-speedrss-domain.com
